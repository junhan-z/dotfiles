#### Yet Another Dotfiles

Trying to make my switch to new machines a lot easier 

For now it is only partly automated for Vim

* Clone this repo to your home directory
`git clone git@github.com:junhan-z/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

* Backup your existing .vim and .vimrc 

* Run the script
`./.dotfiles/install.sh`

* Open Vim
Run `:PlugInstall`

TODO:
* Auto backup current dotfiles
