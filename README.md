#### Yet Another Dotfiles

Trying to make switching to new machines a lot easier 

For now it is only partly automated for Vim

Clone this repo to your home directory
`git clone git@github.com:junhan-z/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

Backup your existing .vim and .vimrc 

Run the script
`./.dotfiles/install.sh`


TODO:
* Auto backup current dotfiles
